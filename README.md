House Price Prediction using Linear Regression
This project is part of my internship work and involves building a Linear Regression model to predict 
house prices using selected features from the Ames Housing Dataset. The model uses features like total
living area, number of bedrooms, and full bathrooms to estimate the sale price of a house.

Technologies Used
Programming Language: Python
Libraries:
pandas – For data loading and preprocessing
scikit-learn – For train-test split, model building, prediction, and evaluation
matplotlib – For data visualization
Google Colab files – For uploading and extracting zipped datasets
